# Web Scraping Projects

I used the Python library __*BeautifulSoup*__ to scrape job postings and room rental listings in Sydney. The data was stored in a DataFrame for analysis with __*Pandas*__ and __*NumPy*__. I then visualized the results using __*Matplotlib*__ and __*Seaborn*__, and created interactive dashboards with __*Dash*__.
